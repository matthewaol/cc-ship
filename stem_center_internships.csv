This  involves thinking about how genomes change over time, what cellular processes enable these  changes, and how novel molecular networks emerge. We consider evolution in the light of  systems biology and systems biology in the light of evolution, to gain a better understanding of  how cells and organisms live and evolve. The research tools we rely on the most are  
bioinformatics, yeast genetics and genomics.
